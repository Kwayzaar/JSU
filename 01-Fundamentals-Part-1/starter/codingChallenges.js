CODING CHALLENGE 1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
*/

const markWeight1 = 78
const markHeight1 = 1.69
const markWeight2 = 95
const markHeight2 = 1.88
const markBMI1 = bmiCalc(markWeight1, markHeight1)
const markBMI2 = bmiCalc(markWeight2, markHeight2)

const johnWeight1 = 92
const johnHeight1 = 1.95
const johnWeight2 = 85
const johnHeight2 = 1.76
const johnBMI1 = bmiCalc(johnWeight1, johnHeight1)
const johnBMI2 = bmiCalc(johnWeight2, johnHeight2)

let markHigherBMI1 = markBMI1 > johnBMI1

let markHigherBMI2 = markBMI2 > johnBMI2

// console.log(markHigherBMI1, markHigherBMI2)

function bmiCalc(weight, height) { //make BMI calculator a function 
  return (weight / height**2).toFixed(1)
}


/* 
Coding Challenge 2 \

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it. 

Your tasks: 
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!" 
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's 

BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"


if(markBMI1 > johnBMI1){
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI1}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI1})!`)
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI ${johnBMI1} is higher than Mark's (${markBMI1})!`)
}

if(markBMI2 > johnBMI2){
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI2}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI2})!`)
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI ${johnBMI2} is higher than Mark's (${markBMI2})!`)
}

Coding Challenge 3

There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each 
other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy! 
Your tasks: 
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below 
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that 
as well (draw means they have the same average score) 
3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a 
team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a 
score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum 
score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ๐ 
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when 
both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 
points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy 

Test data: 
ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110 
ยง Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123 
ยง Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
*/

let dolphinScoreArr = [97, 112, 101]
let koalaScoreArr = [97, 112, 101]

function avgScore(scoreArr) {
  let sum = scoreArr.reduce(
    (a, b) => a + b, 0
  )

  return Number((sum / scoreArr.length).toFixed(0))
}

let dolphinAvgScore = avgScore(dolphinScoreArr)
let koalaAvgScore = avgScore(koalaScoreArr)

if (dolphinAvgScore > koalaAvgScore && dolphinAvgScore >= 100) {
  console.log(`Dolphins win with ${dolphinAvgScore} points!`)
  } else if (dolphinAvgScore < koalaAvgScore && koalaAvgScore > 100) {
  console.log(`Koalas win with ${koalaAvgScore} points!`)
  } else if (dolphinAvgScore === koalaAvgScore && dolphinAvgScore && koalaAvgScore >= 100) {
    console.log("It's a draw!")
  } else {
    console.log("There is no winner :(")
  }
